# Exercise 7.1
## Task 1-3

*Implement concurrent download. You can ignore the cancellation button and
progress bar for now. There seems to be two ways to implement concurrent download
of N webpages. Either (1) create N SwingWorker subclass instances that each
downloads a single webpage; or (2) create a single SwingWorker subclass instance
that itself uses Javaï¿½s executor framework to download the N web pages concurrently.
Approach (1) seems more elegant because it uses the SwingWorker executor framework
only, instead of using two executor frameworks. Also, approach (2) seems dubious
unless it is clear that a SwingWorker's publish method can be safely called
on multiple threads; what does the Java class library documentation say about
this? Implement and explain the correctness of your solution for concurrent
download.*

According to the Java class library documentation, publish sends data chunks to
process and according to the source code of JDK8, `AccumulativeRunnable` is used
which defines that process should be called (it is this `Runnable` that will be
picked up by the UI thread). `AccumulativeRunnable` has a `synchronized` method
called `add()` which accumulates the argument from calls to `publish()`. This
makes `publish()` safe to call from multiple threads. We don't use `publish()`/
`process()` in our solution. We create N `SwingWorker` anonymous subclasses,
which download ean a single web page. If cancelled or when they completes they
will exit the `doInBackground()` method with the result. The UI thread will then
call the `done()` method of the respective `DownloadWorker` instance, which will
append the result to the `TextArea` and call `setProgress()`. This call to
`setProgress()` needs to be propagated to the outer `DownloadWorker`, which is
done by adding an `addPropertyChangeListener` to each SwingWorker on the progress
property (this will then recall `setProgress()` to forward the result to the
listeners of `DownloadWorker`'safe `addPropertyChangeListener`). `DownloadWorker`
will await the completion of all `SwingWorker` anonymous subclasses or for a
cancellation by synchronizing on an `AtomicInteger` called `count`. This will
be incremented by each `SwingWorker` anonymous subclass upon download completion
of a webpage. Using `notifyAll()` inside `SwingWorker` will then notify the outer
`DownloadWorker` which calls wait to check if the count variable equals the number
of `SwingWorker` anonymous subclasses created (or urls processed) or if cancellation
has been thrown. If that is the case, exit `doInBackground()` and write "done" to
the textArea in the `done()` method. Ultimately this will schedule N threads as
a new thread will be created for each `SwingWorker` instance. This way we will
have concurrent download of all webpages written out in any order depending of
which completes first.

# Exercise 7.2
## Task 1

In the bottom-up direction, from the operating system to the GUI, the thread-safety
resides in the fact that the lift threads only share one resource, the User
Interface, which is guarded by a whole thread, the UI thread. This implies that
the GUI is accessed in a very controlled way, which in this case are the `paint()`
and `repaint()` methods of the `Canvas` class.
On the other hand, concurrency in the top-down direction, from the GUI to the
operating system, is handled by making accesses to the `Lift` objects mutually
exclusive: indeed, as many event threads as the number of up/down buttons could
call the method `someLiftTo()` on the `LiftController` instance, making
synchronization necessary. As a side note, some instance methods of the `Lift`
class are `synchronized` even though they are called only from other `synchronized`
instance methods of the same class. However, this is not a problem, thanks to
Java reentrant locks.
