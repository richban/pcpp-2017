// The Dining Philosophers problem, due to E.W. Dijkstra 1965.  Five
// philosophers (threads) sit at a round table on which there are five
// forks (shared resources), placed between the philosophers.  A
// philosopher alternatingly thinks and eats spaghetti.  To eat, the
// philosopher needs exclusive use of the two forks placed to his left
// and right, so he tries to lock them.  

// Both the places and the forks are numbered 0 to 5.  The fork to the
// left of place p has number p, and the fork to the right has number
// (p+1)%5.

// This solution is wrong; it will deadlock after a while.
