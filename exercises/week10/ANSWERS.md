# Exercise 10.2

## Task 1-6
	See source code Exercise10.2.java

## Task 7
	See source code Exercise10.2.java, testing code based on week8->TestStripedWriteMap.java->parallelTest.

## Task 8
	** Explain why such a solution would work in this particular case, even if the test-then-set sequence is not atomic.
	The Holders object is an immutable linked list datastructure. The object where contains is called therefore won't change and
	it will therefore work to simply use contains in the given context of this assignment.
